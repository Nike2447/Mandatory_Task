# MergeSort

# Description
The source code contains a program that will take a list as an input from the user and sort the list using mergesort technique and display the sorted list.
Mergesort is a sorting technique like quicksort where the array is divided into segments before any changes are done to it.
It is an array sorting algorithm which divides the given array into two halves and then again calls the function on those two halves. Then it merges both the halves after sorting.
