Mergesort is an array sorting algorithm which divides the given array into two halves and then again calls the function on those two halves.
Then it merges both the halves after sorting.

In my code i have defined a function mergesort(array) which takes an array as an input.

First we check if there are elements in the array before proceeding.
Then the middle element is initialized.
After which two lists(L,R) for both the halves is made.

The function is again called for both the halves respectively.

Three variables(a,b,c) where a,b,c are the first elements of the lists L,R,array respectively.

Then a while loop is created to traverse both the arrays and check the smallest number which is then added to the main array.

After this the rest of the elements left in the right or left array are added to the main one.
